                    <td colspan="3">As a student taking a database course, I want to learn the fundamentals of database management systems (DBMS) and the skills needed to design, implement, and manage databases for various applications. This may include learning how to create tables, insert data, and retrieve data using Structured Query Language (SQL).

                        Additionally, I want to gain hands-on experience working with popular DBMSs such as MySQL, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server. I also want to learn about data modeling and database design principles, as well as database administration and optimization techniques.
                        
                        In addition to technical skills, I also want to develop soft skills such as problem-solving, communication, and teamwork. These can learn how to collaborate with others to design and implement complex databases and troubleshoot issues that may arise.
                        
                        Finally, I want to learn about emerging trends in the field of database management, such as big data, NoSQL databases, and cloud-based databases. This knowledge can help me stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and prepare them for future careers in the field.
